# Projections 

This Spring Boot application demonstrates the use of JPA projections for efficient data management and retrieval. Projections in Spring Data JPA enable fetching only the fields you need, optimizing query performance and reducing memory overhead. The application manages athlete data, including nested address information, through well-defined projection interfaces.

## Why Use JPA Projections?

### Benefits:
1. **Performance Optimization**: Fetches only required fields, minimizing database load and network transfer.
2. **Simplified Data Access**: Projections map query results directly to Java interfaces, eliminating the need for manual DTO conversions.
3. **Readability and Maintainability**: Projections enforce clear structures, making data retrieval intuitive and focused.

In this application, projections are used to retrieve athlete data along with associated address information in a structured, efficient format.

## Projection Structure

The following interfaces define the projection for athlete and address data:

```java
public interface AthleteResponse {

    String getAthleteId();

    String getName();

    AddressResponse getAddress();
}

public interface AddressResponse {

    String getStreet();

    String getZipCode();

    String getCity();
}
```

- **`AthleteResponse`**: Represents a subset of athlete fields and includes a nested projection for address details.
- **`AddressResponse`**: Represents address fields, simplifying nested data retrieval.

These interfaces ensure that only relevant data is fetched and returned to the client, avoiding unnecessary loading of entity fields.

## Repository Interface

The `AthleteRepository` interface integrates projections to fetch structured data:

```java
public interface AthleteRepository extends Repository<AthleteEntity, Long> {

    Optional<AthleteResponse> findByAthleteId(String athleteId);

    List<AthleteResponse> findAllBy();
}
```

- **`findByAthleteId(String athleteId)`**: Retrieves a single athlete based on their unique ID using the `AthleteResponse` projection.
- **`findAllBy()`**: Fetches a list of all athletes in the `AthleteResponse` projection format.

This design ensures that data queries are efficient and projection-specific, adhering to best practices for performance and maintainability.

## Conclusion

This guide highlights the effective use of Spring Data JPA projections to manage and retrieve data in a structured, performance-oriented manner. By defining interfaces like `AthleteResponse` and integrating them with the repository, the application ensures efficient and scalable data handling.
